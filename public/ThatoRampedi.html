            <p style="text-align: center;">Thato Rampedi is a distinguished brand strategist and content creator who embarked on this career path in 2018. Recognised for his inventive approach, he has diligently built his brand. Thato has managed to carve a unique space in the digital world through vlogging and collaborations with his close friends, showing his ability to leverage personal relationships and digital platforms to maximise his brand's impact.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">In a testament to his versatile digital skills, Thato has expanded his content creation to include podcasting, where he co-hosts a show with his brother. This move highlights his adaptability and showcases his ability to capitalize on various content formats to engage his audience.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center;">Thato's business acumen is evident in his entrepreneurial ventures. He is currently applying his branding experience and business knowledge in new ways by managing another content creator, Mammi Dearest. This venture is an exhibition of his ability to adapt his skills to diverse scenarios and manage brands other than his own, highlighting his strategic and managerial capabilities, as well as a newly launched podcast under his channel called Thought Digest, a podcast that delves into womanhood and everything surrounding women.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center;">As a member of the YouTube group As Majita, Thato continues to push the boundaries of content creation. The group focuses on producing creative and adventurous content, allowing Thato to expand his portfolio further and reach. His collaborations with brands such as Xiaomi, LoversPlus, and MrD Delivery demonstrate his knack for brand strategy and his ability to create content that resonates with audiences, attracting high-profile partnerships.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center;">Thato's skills as a producer shine through in his work on the dating show, <i>Finding Mjolo</i>. Over several seasons, he has partnered with various brands to create unique themes and aesthetics for the show. In season four, he worked with Lovers Plus to bring messages of diversity and sensuality to the forefront. The third season, in partnership with Mr D Delivery, featured a summer aesthetic that celebrated various foods on different dates, showcasing his ability to incorporate brand partnerships into the show's format creatively.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center;">However, Thato's most significant accomplishment to date is the production of <i>AreYouTubedIn Season One</i>, a digital reality TV show filmed in Cape Town. The show brought together multiple content creators for a drama-filled weekend, and it quickly became the number-one trending show at the time of its release. This achievement solidified Thato Rampedi's reputation as a formidable producer in the digital space and a leading figure in content creation and brand strategy.</p>
